# LadyBug
LadyBug for the Acorn BBC Micro Computer range

A remake of Universals Z80 based arcade game from 1981 written in 100% 6502 assembly language to be assembled with the popular BeebAsm assembler

Runs on a BBC B with sideways ram upgrade, BBC B+ 64K/128K (uses 12K workspace ram, no sideways ram needed), BBC Master 128K, BBC Master Compact

I've included two utilities fontmaker and pixels written in c (source code and compiled .exe's) for converting the gimp/photoshop font and tile image files from .raw format to .bin format for inclusion as raw bytes into the game code

**note: this video is of an older build but the game play is virtually identical**\
